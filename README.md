# US Rideshare Analysis
 Using Python script that allows the user to explore bikeshare data from three US cities (New York City, Chigago and Washington)
 Here is the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/deepak525/us-bike-share-analysis/data)


Here are the sources I used to help me complete this project


[First source](https://github.com/ahmed-gharib89/bike-share-udacity-dpnd/blob/master/bikeshare_2.py)

[Second source](https://github.com/giuliotom/Us-BikeShare-Project-/blob/master/bikeshare.py)

[Third source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-concatenation/#+) to learn how to use the + operator

[Fourth source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50866850/ask-user-to-continue-viewing-the-next-5-lines-of-data)

I used the first and second source to have an idea what the project should look like when completed. I used the third and fourth source to 
help me understand concepts
